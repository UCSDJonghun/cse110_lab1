1.	clone the repository onto your local machine using the command line.
 
2.	cd into the repo folder and create a new git branch called "add-read-me" (can be done either locally or through GitHub) and checkout that branch into your local repository.

 
3.	Add the text "<Your name>'s User Page" to the "README.md" file (e.g. "Powell's User Page"). This can be done using a separate text editor.
 
 






4.	add the new file to git.
 
5.	commit the files with the commit message "Update readme file".

 

6. push the commit to the remote branch. (You may need to use the set-upstream flag if you created the branch locally).
